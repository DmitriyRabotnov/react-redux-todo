I can extract the common code between the lifecycle hooks into a separate method. I will call it fetchData. It will fetch the data for the current props.

VisibleTodoList.js

fetchData() {
  fetchTodos(this.props.filter).then(todos =>
    console.log(this.props.filter, todos)
  );
}
In this case, the data we want to fetch only depends on the filter. I'm calling this method from the componentDidMount hook, to fetch the initial data, and I also call it whenever the filter changes inside the componentDidUpdate, lifecycle hook.

VisibleTodoList.js

componentDidMount() {
  this.fetchData();
}

componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
  if (this.props.filter !== prevProps.filter) {
    this.fetchData();
  }
}
We want the fetched todos to become a part of the Redux Store state. The only way to get something into the state is to dispatch an action. I'm going to call the callback prop called receiveTodos, whether to todos I just fetched.

VisibleTodoList.js

fetchData() {
  fetchTodos(this.props.filter).then(todos =>
    this.props.receiveTodos(todos);
  );
}
To make it available inside the component, I need to pass a function called receiveTodos that would be an action creator inside the second argument to connect.

VisibleTodoList.js

VisibleTodoList = withRouter(connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  { onTodoClick: toggleTodo, reveiveTodos }
  )(VisibleTodoList))
Since the name of the function will match the name of the callback prop, I can use the shorter ES6 property notation.

I will import receiveTodos from the file where I define all other action creators.

VisibleTodoList.js

import { toggleTodo, receiveTodos } from '../actions';
Now, I can open that file with the action creators and actually implement it.

I'm creating a new export const function called receiveTodos that takes the server response as an argument and returns an object with the type of receiveTodos and the response as a field.

The reducer is handling this action. We'll need to know which filter the response corresponds to so I'm adding a filter as an argument to the receiveTodos action creator and I'm passing it as part of the action object.

index.js

export const receiveTodos = (filter, response) => ({
  type: 'RECEIVE_TODOS',
  filter,
  response,
});
I'm going back to my component so I can pass the filter through the action creator. I'm destructering the filter and receiveTodos from props using ES6 destructering syntax. It's important that I destructer the filter right away, because by the time the callback fires this.props.filter might have changed because they use it and might have navigated away.

VisibleTodoList.js

fetchData() {
  const { filter, receiveTodos } = this.props;
  fetchTodos(this.props.filter).then(todos =>
    receiveTodos(filter, todos)
  );
}
If around the app now, I will see Redux actions being dispatched, ready to be handled by the reducers. They include all the necessary information, such as the filter and the server response.

[Dispatched Action](../images/javascript-redux-dispatching-actions-with-the-fetched-data-dispatched-action.png)

As I navigate through the app, the component fetches data in lifecycle hooks and dispatches Redux actions when the data is ready. As a final touch, I like to write less boilerplate code when importing action creators.

I'm replacing name to imports with the namespace import so that any function exported from the actions file will be in the object called actions, which I will pass as a second argument to connect.

VisibleTodoList.js

import * as actions from '../reducers';

VisibleTodoList = withRouter(connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  actions
)(VisibleTodoList));
I'm destructuring the props, because the toggleTodo action creator needs to be passed under onTodoClick callback prop name, but the rest of the props can be passed as the other.

VisibleTodoList

render() {
  const { toggleTodo, ...rest } this.props;
  return <TodoList {...this.props} />;
}
The rest object now continues all the props other than to toggleTodo, so I will pass them through. I will also pass toggleTodo as onTodoClick prop, because that's what TodoList component expect.

VisibleTodoList

render() {
  const { toggleTodo, ...rest } this.props;
  return <TodoList 
          {...rest} 
          onTodoClick={toggleTodo} 
          />;
}
Finally, I'm splitting it over multiple lines for a little better readability. Let's recap how we fetch asynchronously in response to route changes. In the file where I define action creators, I add a new action creator called receiveTodos that accepts the filter and the response as arguments.

index.js

export const receiveTodos = (filter, response) => ({
  type: 'RECEIVE_TODOS',
  filter,
  response,
});
It produces a regular Redux action object that can be dispatched after the request of the server has completed. I created a new react class component so that I can use lifecycles hooks, such as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate to fetch the data.

VisibleTodoList.js

componentDidMount() {
  this.fetchData();
}

componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
  if (this.props.filter !== prevProps.filter) {
    this.fetchData();
  }
}
I'm fetching the data when the component mounts for the first time and if the filter prop, provided by react router changes, which means that user has navigated in the app. The VisibleTodoList is the container component that enhances a presentational component called TodoList when the data fetch an object.

However, the class we wrote does not subscribe to the store itself so we wrap it in a connect() call so that the containers generated by react Redux connect subscribes to the store and passes the props through the VisibleTodoList component we wrote.

VisibleTodoList.js

VisibleTodoList = withRouter(connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  actions
)(VisibleTodoList));
Finally, the component generated by withRouter subscribes to the router changes so we have access to the router params in mapStateToProps. The components we want to export are the result of colon disrupters so I reassign VisibleTodoList and export it.

VisibleTodoList.js

const mapStateToProps = (state, { parama }) => {
  const filter = params.filter || 'all';
  return {
    todos: getVisibleTodos(state, filter),
    filter,
  };
};
Inside the mapStateToProps, I read the filter value from the parameters supply direct order or use the default value. I used to only use filter for calculating the getVisibleTodos, but now, I also want to pass it as a prop so that it's available inside the component.

Having access to the filter prop, let's determine whether I should fetch the data and pass it to the function that fetches todos. I import this function from the file where I define our fake API, which can be replaced by rest API client.

VisibleTodoList.js

fetchData() {
  const { filter, receiveTodos } = this.props;
  fetchTodos(filter).then(todos =>
    receiveTodos(filter, todos)
  );
}
We fetch data when the component mounts and when the filter prop changes. fetchTodos return the promise so when it resolves, I use the response, to dispatch an action receiveTodos with the filter and the server response.

The receiveTodos function available on the props dispatches the action returned by receiveTodos action creator automatically. This happens because I pass at this part of the actions object to connect.

VisibleTodoList.js

VisibleTodoList = withRouter(connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  actions
)(VisibleTodoList));
The actions object contains all the exported action creators defined in the actions.js file, because I use the ES6 namespace import syntax. The receiveTodos action creator does not automatically dispatch an action, but the receiveTodos prop injected by connect does.

When I call it, it will call my action creator with the same arguments and dispatch the resultant action to the Redux Store. Inside the render() method, I render to the presentational TodoList component.

VisibleTodoList.js

render() {
  const { toggleTodo, ...rest } this.props;
  return <TodoList 
          {...rest} 
          onTodoClick={toggleTodo} 
          />;
}
Now that all action creators are injected as props with the same names, I have to grab toggleTodo specifically and pass it as onTodoClick called by prop that TodoList expects, but the rest props can be passed with their existing names.
